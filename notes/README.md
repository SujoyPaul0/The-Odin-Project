# Phases of Web Dev:

    Learning to code is challenging due to unrealistic expectations and shifts in Resource Density and Scope of Knowledge.
    Key phases:
        Phase I: Hand-Holding Honeymoon: Joyful, high resources, narrow scope. Tip: Pick one resource.
        Phase II: Cliff of Confusion: Hand-holding ends, debugging difficult. Tip: Build constantly, work with others.
        Phase III: Desert of Despair: Lost, low resources, scope balloons. Tip: Strong goal, find a clear path.
        Phase IV: Upswing of Awesome: Apps work, but code brittle; self-doubt. Tip: Seek best practices, get feedback.
    Understanding phases aids navigating this journey successfully.

# History of Web Development:

    Web design involves skills for producing and maintaining websites, encompassing graphic design, UI/UX, and SEO. Its history began with text-only HTML (1991-1993), evolving with graphical browsers (Mosaic, 1993). The W3C established standards, influencing the "browser wars" (1996-1999) that introduced CSS, JavaScript, and Dynamic HTML. Since 2001, HTML5, CSS3, and mobile-first design (around 2012) became crucial.
        Key skills and techniques include:
        UX Design and ensuring web accessibility.
        Responsive web design to adapt to varying screen sizes.
    Maintaining quality of code through standards and validation.
    Websites are either static (unique files) or dynamic (server-generated, often database-driven). Primary occupations are web designer (visuals) and web developer. AI models like Chat GPT are increasingly used for faster creation.

# Web Development Summary:

    Front-end developers build the user interface using HTML, CSS, JS, and frameworks like ReactJS and Bootstrap. They ensure visual appeal and usability. Back-end developers manage the server, database, and application logic using Node.js, PHP, Python, and databases like MySQL or MongoDB. They handle data security, scalability, and APIs. Full stack developers work across both ends, mastering front-end and back-end skills, plus CMS tools (WordPress). Full stack offers flexibility but requires broad expertise.
    Salaries (US avg.): Front-end: ~$96K; Back-end: ~$164K; Full stack: ~$137K.
    Job outlook: ~16-17% growth (2022-2032).
    Soft skills: Problem-solving, adaptability, communication are key.
    Continuous learning is vital in this dynamic field.
