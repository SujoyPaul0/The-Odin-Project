# Phases of Web Dev:

    Learning to code is challenging due to unrealistic expectations and shifts in Resource Density and Scope of Knowledge.
    Key phases:
        Phase I: Hand-Holding Honeymoon: Joyful, high resources, narrow scope. Tip: Pick one resource.
        Phase II: Cliff of Confusion: Hand-holding ends, debugging difficult. Tip: Build constantly, work with others.
        Phase III: Desert of Despair: Lost, low resources, scope balloons. Tip: Strong goal, find a clear path.
        Phase IV: Upswing of Awesome: Apps work, but code brittle; self-doubt. Tip: Seek best practices, get feedback.
    Understanding phases aids navigating this journey successfully.
